      When artists and crafters refer to the resin they use to create "resin art", they’re almost always talking about epoxy resin. Initially, epoxy resin was used in industrial applications. That is, until artists discovered that a shiny coat of resin provided a sleek, modern finish and made the color in paintings and photographs pop.
      Resin art is one of the most diverse mediums of art out there, both as a stand-alone art form and as a means of supplementing other disciplines such as installation art, painting, and even furniture design. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll be looking at the type of art you’re able to make with a resin specifically, so what exactly is resin art?
      Epoxy resin is typically a primary choice for artists because of the variety of resin artwork one can use it for. It is also one of the safest types of resin to use on your art projects. It is also easier to work with and has a milder odor than most types of resin. Epoxy and polymer fall under the category of thermosetting plastics.
